0_kmeans_montereybay.js:
- code walk through - reference to eefabook.org
- look at kmeans with snic off
    -  play with number of clusters where there are clouds - does it help?
- turn snic on
    - explain overarching snic method - seeds, neighborhoods, similar to 'density-based' clustering
- active: discuss benefits and tradeoffs for snic vs pixel-level classification


1_supervised_montereybay.js:
- making a training dataset
- CART and RF
- confusion matrix
    - what does this tell us? where is the model likely to be confused?
- overall performance summary

2_supervised_applied_montereybay.js
- application of CART on 5 images
- transferability?
- how would we make this model better?
- other use cases of CART classification
