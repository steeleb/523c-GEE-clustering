# Clustering Methods Overview

::: notes
Clustering is an *unsupervised* learning method.

Overall, it's a process to find **meaningful** structure in a dataset
:::

## \[some\] Types of clustering

::: incremental
-   partition clustering

-   hierarchical clustering

-   density-based clustering

-   model-based clustering
:::

::: notes
at least that is broadly applicable to this group
:::

## Partition Clustering

TL;DR: you define how many classes there are, and clustering prioritizes minimizing the dissimilarity between points.

:::

## Hierarchical clustering

TL;DR: you define measures of similarity and either iteratively merge (agglomeritive) or iteratively split (divisive) to create a hierarchy.

:::

## Density-based clustering

TL;DR: computer defines areas of high density separated by areas of low density

# How do we account for space/distance?

::: {.fragment .incremental}
replace 'similarity' with 'distance':

-   you define how many classes there are, and clustering prioritizes minimizing the **distance** between points.

-   you define measures of **distance** and either iteratively merge (agglomeritive) or iteratively split (divisive) to create a hierarchy.
:::

::: notes
but here, distance not only means distance means both spatial distance AND similarity on other dimensions
:::

# Evaluation metrics \[commonly used with k-means\]

::: incremental
-   silhouette coefficient

-   Davies-Boudin index / Calinski-Harabasz Index
:::

::: notes
SC: computing the average distance between data points in the same cluster and the average distance between data points in different clusters (values for -1 to 1, higher the better)

DBI: measures the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster, while also taking into account the average dissimilarity within each cluster. The lower the value the better

CHI: measures the ratio of the between-cluster variance to the within-cluster variance. The higher the ratio, the better.

The focus here is to help define what is **meaningful**.

::: notes
what do you notice about the second to last line?

# Introducing our Ecological Question

::: {.fragment .incremental .smaller}
-   Can we define the area of the Ocean off the coast of California impacted by sediment plumes from the overwhelming precipitation events of the recent past?

-   within the context of the Landsat mission's history, has this ever happened before?
